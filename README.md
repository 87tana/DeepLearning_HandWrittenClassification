# DeepLearning_HandWrittenClassification

A handwritten digits dataset is a collection of digital images of handwritten digits, typically used for training and testing machine learning models in **image recognition and classification tasks**.  
One of the most well-known handwritten digits datasets is the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset,
which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. 
The MNIST dataset has been used extensively as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees.
